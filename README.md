Editor Tabbing
==============

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that lets you move between text inputs using (Shift +) Tab.

The mod detects when Steam Overlay could be triggered by Shift + Enter and has a toggle option to only use just Enter to move to the next field and just Tab to move back when both are the case.


## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [EditorTabbing.dll](https://github.com/lill-la/ResoniteEditorTabbing/releases/latest/download/EditorTabbing.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
